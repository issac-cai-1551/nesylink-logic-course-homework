  Task4Formalization.lean

  对应关卡 mathematical_logic/task_4：
  - 5 个房间：west(-1,0), center(0,0), north(0,-1), east(1,0), south(0,1)
  - 玩家初始无剑（只有盾）
  - center 房间有 rotating_bridge，3 种状态（由 west 的 switch 控制）
  - north 房间有宝箱（含钥匙）
  - east 房间有宝箱（含剑），需钥匙开门（不消耗钥匙）
  - south 房间有 1 个 monster（guardian）
  - 最终宝箱在 center，击败所有怪物后显现
  - 最大步数 2000

  流程：踩 switch 切换桥方向 → 去 north 拿钥匙 → 去 east 拿剑
        → 去 south 杀怪 → 回 center 开最终宝箱

  对应 Agent 代码：
