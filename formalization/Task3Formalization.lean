  对应关卡 mathematical_logic/task_3：
  - 3 个房间：start_room(0,0), monster_hall(-1,0), key_room(-2,0)
  - start_room：全空地，西出口→monster_hall，东侧锁门（需钥匙）
  - monster_hall：全空地，1 个 chaser 怪物 (5,3)
  - key_room：全空地，1 个宝箱 (5,4) 含钥匙
  - 流程：穿怪物房→去西侧拿钥匙→返回→开东侧锁门
  - 最大步数 1500

  对应 Agent 代码：
    symbolicPlanner 管理房间图，跨房间通过 goExit 子目标 + 房间级 BFS 导航
